I am a physicist at Duke University studying the production of charm
quarks in hadron collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.  I have
taught recitation sections and labs for the introductory courses in
the Duke Physics department.  Below you will find my <a href="#sec-2">Philosophy of Teaching</a> and my <a href="#sec-3">Curriculum Vitae</a>.  Throughout the document you will
find links to additional material which may be of interest.

<p>
I care deeply about communicating my work clearly, concisely and with
good design. To that end I've been significantly influenced by:

</li>
<li>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information - Edward Tufte

<h2 id="sec-2">Philosophy of Teaching</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I have had many instructors in the course of my education, and two
stand out above all others in the impact that they have had on the way
I approach learning and solving problems.  In reflecting on my personal
teaching philosophy I have realized that these two instructors have
also had a significant influence on how I view instructor-student
interactions.  When I approached my high school calculus teacher about
taking the course out of sequence without the prerequisite, his
response was to offer after-hours help and give me the calculus
textbook to study over the summer.  He emphasized strategy and
efficient execution over rote memory and brute force.  During my
freshman year of college, I failed my first physics midterm miserably.
When I met with my professor he worked with me to develop an
extra-curricular study plan, and offered time outside of office hours
to meet and discuss homework problems.  Both of these instructors met
me at my level, provided me with extra resources, and enabled me to
succeed.
</p>

<p>
In order to carry this forward, I believe that it is the
responsibility of any teacher to provide as many resources to enable
learning as possible.  This means providing multiple perspectives a
topic, the one presented by the book, my perspective, and the a
perspective supported by mathematics.  Office hours provided
one-on-one interactions with students that allow me to refine my
explanations of concepts that can be reincorporated into recitation
instruction.  As recitation instructor for "Introduction to Physics
for Engineers", I plan my lessons to complement lectures.  Students
approach physics from different levels and backgrounds, and it is
important for me to adapt to the student in order to enable efficient
learning.  Some students require individual attention.  Sometimes this
means explaining a concept in detail, and sometimes it means
discussing test taking techniques that enable them to succeed.  I am
available for individual meetings as well as office hours.
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of meeting students on their level is the teacher's
responsibility to provide a safe learning environment.  This means
making mistakes part of the learning process.  This can be achieved in
many different ways.  Small groups in office hours allow me to ask one
student to explain to another how a concept works, and also allows
students the opportunity to work in front of me so I can see their
reasoning.  Individual meetings can address student anxieties that can
be repressed in a more public classroom setting.  Another way to
achieve a safe learning environment is to have students discuss some
aspect of the problem with their peers in the classroom.  This starts
a dialog that allows for peer learning, and it enables students to
express their thinking out loud.  I ask students to discuss questions
in groups of two or three, and then I move between the groups to
facilitate discussions by asking students to explain their solution to
me, or by clarifying and guiding groups that struggle.  Shuffling the
groups from time to time in invigorates discussion and seems to have a
positive impact on peer interactions.
</p>

<p>
I believe that all students can master the material when they are held
accountable, given adequate time, and are motivated.  Accountability
means that the students' learning happens on their own account.  I
engage in a question-answer dialogue, which leads the student through
the problem, allowing them to come to the solution on their own.  I
also check students homework when they struggle, ensuring it is
completed and the solutions are communicated clearly.  Finally, I
believe that the instructor should be as accountable as the student.
Therefore, when I make an error on the board that a student catches
and corrects, he or she receives a reward.
</p>

<p>
One of the most valuable products of each semester I've taught is the
student reviews.  They provide an unvarnished assessment of my
teaching.  I pay careful attention to the written comments and do my
best to incorporate changes to address them.  One comment I received
during my first semester teaching was that I erased the board too
quickly.  In subsequent semesters I now ask if anyone needs the board
before erasing.  In my most recent semester teaching, students rated
my confidence with the material lower than I had hoped.  On
reflection, I think this was due to my questioning the students if my
choice of problems were too difficult.  In future semesters I will
find different ways to assess how the students are handling the
material.  In future semesters I will solicit feedback midway to
address problems before finding out about them after the fact.
</p>

<p>
I have just begun my teaching career and the experiences I have had so
far have been formative.  One of the best moments I had as a
recitation instructor was when one of my students finally understood
how static and kinetic friction are related to the normal force
applied to an object.  This "A-Hah!" moment when a student makes the
transition from confusion to understanding is why I teach.  In order
to develop my ability to facilitate this moment, I am enrolled in the
Certificate of College Teaching program at Duke.  I am developing my
teaching skills so that one day I will have the same impact that my
high school calculus teacher, and my freshman physics teacher had on
me.
